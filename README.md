# RainyWindowSimulation
Creates a rainy window simulation of looking out the car when you were a kid.
Craeted as a project for Creative Programming 2 - Simulation/Final Project.

## Origin
In my childhood, one of the most distinctive moments I remember were these car rides through the country on rainy afternoons.  Whether we were coming back from a trip or just driving to get something from the store, these moments of staring out the window as the rain washed down over the car, was something that I always found fascinating.  Through the project, I wanted to re-create, to some degree, the relaxation and almost somber environment that I remember from when I was a kid.  In nothing else, I hope that some others can find memories of themselves in this piece, as I did.

### Getting It Running On Your Machine
Unfortunately, this is not a full repository, as github wouldn’t let me upload my rain noise file.  Fair enough github, it is 30 minutes long, but still.  So in order to run this sketch you’ll have to supply your own rain mp3 or visit the youtube link listed as the source of the rain noise in the comments of the code itself.
