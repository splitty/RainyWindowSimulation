# RainyWindowSimulation
Creates a rainy window simulation of looking out the car when you were a kid.
Craeted as a project for Creative Programming 2 - Simulation/Final Project.

## Origin
In my childhood, one of the most distinctive moments I remember were these car rides through the country on rainy afternoons.  Whether we were coming back from a trip or just driving to get something from the store, these moments of staring out the window as the rain washed down over the car, was something that I always found fascinating.  Through the project, I wanted to re-create, to some degree, the relaxation and almost somber environment that I remember from when I was a kid.  In nothing else, I hope that some others can find memories of themselves in this piece, as I did.

### Getting It Running On Your Machine
Unfortunately, this is not a full repository, as github wouldn’t let me upload my rain noise file.  Fair enough github, it is 30 minutes long, but still.  So in order to run this sketch you’ll have to supply your own rain mp3 or visit the youtube link listed as the source of the rain noise in the comments of the code itself. 

## Research And Sketches
Maybe it’s because car rides are inherently boring from the passenger’s perspective, or maybe it’s because kids just don’t have a strong grasp of how to deal with the slower passing of time, but, a system of nature that has always intrigued me has been the movement of singular droplets of water over or onto a surface.  The most notable memory of this system, and what I imagine many others have as well, is the long rainy car or bus ride staring out the windows as the droplets of rain manage to reach the low pressure zone produced by the indentation of the window cavity.  From there, the droplets seem to meander their way down the side of the window, leaving streaks and smaller fragments of a once larger whole behind as it makes its way through the frame.

I’ve always been fascinated by the way in which these droplets interact with the low pressure zone of the window indentations, as well as the way that they attract and combine with nearby droplets to gain slightly in momentum as their mass increases and so too does their speed towards the rear of the car.
Over the past few weeks I’ve spent an unreasonable amount of time in my car, either driving for enjoyment or moving back down to Florida.  As such, I’ve had this topic fresh in my mind, and while I was washing my car earlier this week a particular event popped out as something for this project.

The above image is the depiction of my fender with the water droplets from the hose that sit until the friction becomes too little to hold on and they proceed to plummet onto my wheel below.  It occurs because of two events, firstly, the waxed paint produces a hydrophobic coating that will repel water, meaning the surface tension does not have anywhere for the water to hold on to, forming a ball instead of a streak.  Additionally, the slight movement of air or a shake in the car from the pressure washer on the other side will produce enough force to overcome the friction holding the droplet horizontally on the fender.  Finally, as this droplet breaks its hold on the fender, it gains momentum and in turn races towards the bottom of the fender, where it holds onto the underside (non waxed) part of the fender until enough force is provided to override the droplet’s surface tension and it breaks, sending the majority of the droplet down onto the wheel.

This second image is an extension of the first’s movement and interaction with surface tension and momentum.  In this example, I used a small spray bottle to spritz a leaf that I had coated with wax.  When that water hits the leaf, it first acts as a force to push the leaf down towards the ground, and with too much wax will proceed to just slide right off.  This was not the effect I had in mind and remembered seeing on TV shows and movies.  In order to get the droplet to hit, stick for a second, then release, I needed a leaf that was only waxed UP TO the tip, but leaving the tip unwaxed.  This proved to be a solid way of reproducing the typical droplet hits, leaf descends slightly, droplet releases, then leaf bounces back up.  The wax on the larger part of the leaf helps the water to roll down onto the actual tip, where having a non-hydrophobic place allows for the water to hold onto for a brief moment before actually falling from the force.  Additionally, I am awed by the way in which even a normal leaf will produce this effect more often than not.  Even with oddly sized leaves, the leaves will proceed to repel the water in a way that is soft enough to not hurt the leaf or connection to the branch, but with enough force to reliably remove the water so that it doesn’t just sit on the leaf itself.  It seems like the construction of a leaf, is almost meant in a way to perform that action.
